#What is material Design
Material makes more liberal use of grid-based layouts, responsive animations and transitions, padding, and depth effects such as lighting and shadows.

#The Material Design Layout Principles
The design priciple is based on design-print elements such as typography,grids,space,scale,color and imagery to create heirachy, meaning and focus that immerse user in the experience.

Tools are adapted from fields such as print and design like base line grids and stractural templates encouraging consistency across platforms and screen sizes by repeating visual elements, stactural grids and spacing.

##How paper works
In material desing the physical properties are translated to the screen, the background of an application resembles the flat, opaque textuer of a sheet of paper.
The behaviour of an application  mimics the abilty of a paper to be resize,shuffled and bound together in multiple sheets.but element that live outside applications like the status and system bars, recieve different treatment since they are separate from the app content thats benteath them and thus not carrying the properties of paper. 

###Seams
Two sheets of paper that share an entire common edge are called seams. While joined by a seam, they move together.

####Steps
Two overlapping sheets of paper, with different z-positions (or depths), form a step. They move independently of each other.

###FLoating Action Buttons
A floating action button is a circular sheet separate from a toolbar. It represents a single promoted action.
It can straddle a step if it relates to the content creating that step.

A floating action button can straddle a seam if it relates to the content of both sheets.
Do not introduce a decorative seam to provide an anchoring point for an action.
